# Diffy - A tool for sharing diffs

## How to contribute

Diffy is a Node.js application. Appart from Node.js, the only other
thing you'll need is mongodb. To get you started these are the steps:

1. Install Node.js and NPM
2. Install MongoDB and make it listen on localhost with default port
3. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/pbu88/diffy.git`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Run the tests: `nodeunit tests`
6. Run it: `node app.js`

That should get you with a basic working dev environment. Now, go ahead
and fill your pull request :)
